Recruitment Rules· \\n[ Guidelines om RRs - OM, dated 6-3-2.QH ]; \\nRecruitment Rules are rules notified under proviso to: Art.id\\'e 3.09 or \\nany specific statutes. for post(s) prescribing the method of recruitment and· \\neligibility conditions. It contains a notification past hra\\'.ki:mg substantive rules \\nand a schedule part. Recruitment Rules are subordinate legislation and so; \\nthey are statutory in nature. Recruitment Rules for Group· \\'A\" and \\'B\\' posts/ \\nservices are amended by the administrative Mini.s~ry /, Department in \\nconsultation with the Department of Personnel and Praining, Urrior.r Public \\nService Commission and the Ministry of Law (Legislative Department) and \\napproval of competent authority in the Ministry/ Department to be obtained .. \\nAdministrative Ministries/ Departments are empowered to trar,me/ amend\\' \\nthe Recruitment Rules in respect of Group \\'C posts keeping inr view the \\nguidelines/ Model Recruitment Rules issued b,y this- Department on various \\naspects. In case of deviation from existing guidelines / Mod.el· Recruitment \\nRules, the concurrence of Department of Personnel and Training is to be \\nobtained. \\nThe minimum educational qualifications and experience required \\nfor direct recruitment may be indicated as precisely as possible and if \\nnecessary into two parts, viz., \"Essential Qualifications\" and \"Desirable \\nQualifications\" taking into account the pay level and the nature of duties, \\nand the provisions in the approved Recruitment Rules for similar higher and \\nlower posts in the same hierarchy. \\n2. Methods of Recruitment \\nThe different methods of recruitment are: \\n(a) Direct Recruitment (b) Promotion \\n(c) Deputation (d) Absorption \\n(e) Re-employment (f) Short-term contract \\nDirect recruitment is the recruitment which is open to al.I candidates, \\neligible as per the provisions regarding age, educational qualification / \\nexperience etc., as prescribed in Recruitment Rules. \\nPromotion is method of recruitment from feeder grade post(s) to \\nhigher post in the hierarchy as per the provisions of the Recruitment Rules. \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Data.pdf', 'page': 13}, page_content='2 SWAMY\\'S HANDBOOK - 2024 \\nIf promotion is kept as a method of recruitment, it is also necessary to lay \\ndown the number of years of qualifying service before the persons in the \\nfield become eligible for promotion. Only regular, and not ad hoc, period \\nof service is taken into account for purposes of computing this service. \\nDeputation is a method of recruitment where officers of Central \\nGovernment Departments or State / UT Governments from outside are \\nappointed to post(s) in Central Government for a limited period, by the end \\nof which they will have to return to their parent cadres. In case of isolated \\npost, it is desirable to keep the method of recruitment of deputation / short \\nterm contract as otherwise the incumbents of such posts, if directly recruited, \\nwill not have any avenue of promotion/ career progression. \\nShort-term contract is also a form of deputation where officers from \\nnon-Government bodies e.g. universities, research institutions, public \\nsector undertakings for teaching, research, scientific and technical post(s) \\ncan come to Central Government posts. \\nAbsorption and deputation are not same. There is a substantial difference \\nbetween absorption and deputation. The officer, who initially comes on \\ndeputation, may be permanently absorbed in the post/ grade if recruitment \\nrules prescribe for absorption as mode of recruitment. Such absorption \\ncan be effected only in the case of officers who are on deputation from the \\nCentral / State Government. \\nRe-employment.- Armed Forces personnel, including those in the \\nMilitary, Naval and Air Forces, retire at younger ages compared to other \\nGovernment employees, as their duties are physically demanding. When \\nthey retire, usually between the ages of 35 and 54 depending on their \\nrank, most ex-servicemen require assistance for resettlement. They need \\na second career because they are still young and active, and their responsi\\xad \\nbilities and obligations are at their peak when they are compulsorily \\nretired. Considering their dedicated service to the country\\'s safety and \\nsecurity, it is a national obligation to provide necessary facilities for their \\nresettlement. To address this, the Central Government has introduced the \\n\"Ex-Servicemen (Re-employment in Central Civil Services and Posts) Rules.\" \\nThe recruitment rules regulating the recruitment of persons to Group-C \\nand MTS posts and services under the Central Government shall be \\nsubject to the provisions of these rules and shall be construed accordingly. \\n3. Composite method of recruitment \\nIn cases where the field of promotion or feeder grade consists of only \\none post, the method of recruitment by \"deputation (including short-term \\ncontract)/ promotion\" is prescribed so that the eligible departmental officer \\nis considered along with outsiders. If the departmental candidate is selected \\nfor appointment to the post, it is to be treated as having been filled by \\npromotion; otherwise, the post is to be filled by deputation / short-term \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Data.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content=\"RECRUITMENT 3 \\ncontract for the prescribed period of deputation / short-term contract at the \\nend of which the departmental officer will again be afforded an opportunity \\nto be considered for appointment to the post. \\nThe field for deputation / short-term contract / absorption should, \\nas far as possible, consist of officers holding analogous posts on regular \\nbasis but may be widened to include officers working in the next lower \\ngrade also with the qualifying service on regular basis normally prescribed \\nfor promotion. \\n4. Consultation with UPSC \\nUPSC is required to be consulted in case of recruitment to all Central \\nCivil Services and Central Civil Posts. Exemption from consultation with \\nUPSC is governed by UPSC (Exemption from Consultation) Regulations, 1958, \\nas amended from time to time. \\n5. Direct recruitment to another post \\nin same or different department \\nIf a Government servant is appointed to another post by direct recruitment \\neither in the same department or a different department, it may be necessary \\nto consider him for confirmation in the new post in which he has been \\nappointed by direct recruitment irrespective of the fact that the officer was \\nholding the earlier post on a substantive basis. Confirmation in the new \\nentry grade becomes necessary because the new post may not be in the \\nsame line or discipline and the job requirements may be quite different \\nfrom the old post in which he has been confirmed. \\n6. Probation \\nA person is appointed on probation to assess their suitability for the job. \\nProbation is not just a formality and does not require a formal declaration. \\nThe Appointing Authority can declare successful completion, extend \\nthe probation period, or terminate the services based on performance \\nevaluation. \\nProbation is used for direct recruitment, promotion, or re-employment \\nbefore superannuation. It should not be excessively prolonged. The power \\nto discharge probationers should be actively used to avoid later termination. \\nBesides passing exams, the focus should be on evaluating the \\nprobationer's outlook, character, and aptitude for the job before confirming \\ntheir appointment. \\nDuring probation, the probationer should work under multiple officers, \\nand their performance should be assessed by each one. Separate probation \\nreports, distinct from regular Annual Performance Appraisal Reports (APARs), \\nshould be used for this purpose. \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Data.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content=\"4 SWAMY'$ HANDBOOK - 2024 \\nProbation should not be extended for more than a year, except for \\nexceptional reasons, and should not exceed double the normal period. \\nIf a probationer is not progressing satisfactorily, they should be informed \\nof their shortcomings and given an opportunity to improve. Written warning \\nshould be given, and discharge should only be considered if there is no \\nsubstantial improvement. \\nThe Government may require probationers to undergo training, \\ninstructions, exams and tests during their probation period. This is a \\ncondition for satisfactory completion of probation, including an examination \\nin Hindi, if necessary. \\nPERIOD OF PROBATION \\nThe period of probation is prescribed for different posts / services \\nin Central Government on the following lines: \\nSI. \\nNo. Method of appointment Period of Probation \\nPROMOTION \\n1.

Adjustment against unreserved vacancies \\n(i) In the category of posts which are identified suitable for persons \\nwith benchmark disabilities, a person with benchmark disability \\ncannot be denied the right to compete for appointment by \\ndirect recruitment against an unreserved vacancy. Thus a person \\nwith benchmark disability can be appointed by direct recruitment \\nagainst vacancy not specifically reserved for the persons with \\nbenchmark disability, provided the post is identified suitable for \\npersons with benchmark disability of the relevant category. \\n(ii) Persons with benchmark disabilities selected without relaxed \\nstandards along with other candidates, will not be adjusted against \\nthe reserved share of vacancies. The reserved vacancies will be \\nfilled up separately from amongst the eligible candidates with \\nbenchmark disabilities which will thus comprise of candidates \\nwith benchmark disabilities who are lower in merit than the \\nlast candidate in merit list but otherwise found suitable for \\nappointment, if necessary, by relaxed standards. \\n4.

Since reservation for \\nPersons with Benchmark Disabilities is provided computing total \\nnumber of vacancies in the cadre strength in identified category of \\nposts as well as unidentified category of posts, it may be possible \\nthat number of persons appointed by reservation in an identified \\ncategory of post may exceed four per cent. \\n(ii) Reservation for persons with benchmark disabilities in Group 'A' \\nor Group 'B' posts shall be computed on the basis of total number \\nof vacancies occurring in direct recruitment quota in the cadre in \\nall the Group 'A' posts or Group 'B' posts respectively, and the \\ncomputation of total vacancies shall include vacancies arising in \\nthe identified and non-identified category of posts. \\n6. Maintenance of Rosters \\n(i) Every Government establishment shall maintain group-wise a \\nseparate vacancy-based 100-point vacancy-based reservation \\nroster register for determining / effecting reservation for the \\nPersons with Benchmark Disabilities - one each for Group 'A', \\nGroup 'B' and Group 'C' posts filled by direct recruitment. \\n(ii) Each register shall have cycles of 100 points and each cycle of \\n100 points shall be divided into four blocks, comprising the \\nfollowing points:- \\n1 st Block - point No. 01 to point No. 25 \\n2nd Block - point No. 26 to point No. 50 \\n3rd Block - point No. 51 to point No. 75 \\n4th Block - point No. 76 to point No. 100 \\n(iii) Points 1, 26, 51 and 76 of the roster shall be earmarked for persons \\nwith benchmark disabilities - one point each for four respective \\ncategories of disabilities. The Head of the establishment shall \\nensure that vacancies identified at SI. Nos. 1, 26, 51 and 76 \\nare earmarked for the respective categories of the persons with \\nbenchmark disabilities. However, the Head of the establishment \\nshall decide the placement of the selected candidate in the \\nroster register. \\n(l:v) AIJ the vacancies arising irrespective of vacancies reserved for \\nPersons with Benchmark Disabilities shall be entered in the relevant \\nroster. If the vacancy falling at point no. 1 is not identified for the \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Data.pdf', 'page': 34}, page_content='RESERVATIONS AND CONCESSIONS IN APPOINTMENTS 23 \\nPerson with Benchmark Disability or the Head of the establishment \\nconsiders it desirable not to fill it up by Persons with Benchmark \\nDisabilities or it is not possible to fill up that post by the Persons \\nwith Benchmark Disabilities for any other reason, one of the \\nvacancies falling at any of the points from 2 to 25 shall be treated \\nas reserved for the person with benchmark disability and filled \\nas such. \\n(v) Likewise, a vacancy falling at any of the points from 26 to 50 or from \\n51 to 75 or from 76 to 100 shall have to be filled by the Persons \\nwith Benchmark Disabilities. The purpose of keeping points 1, \\n26, 51 and 76 as reserved is to fill up the first available suitable \\nvacancy. \\n(vi) There is a possibility that none of the vacancies from 1 to 25 is \\nsuitable for any category of the person with benchmark disability. \\nIn that case, two vacancies from 26 to 50 shall be filled as reserved \\nfor persons with benchmark disabilities. If the vacancies from \\n26 to 50 are also not suitable for any category, three vacancies shall \\nbe filled as reserved from the third block containing points from \\n51 to 75. This means that if no vacancy can be reserved in \\na particular block, it shall be carried over into the next block \\n(vii) After all the 100 points of the roster are covered, a fresh cycle of \\n100 points shall start. \\n(viii) If the number of vacancies in a year is such as to cover only one \\nblock (say 25 vacancies) or two (say 50 vacancies), the category of \\nthe persons with benchmark disabilities should be accommodated \\nas per the roster points. However, in case, the said vacancy is not \\nidentified for the respective category, the Head of the establishment \\nshall decide the category on the basis of the nature of the \\npost, the level of representation of the specific disabled category \\nin the concerned grade/ post, etc. \\n7. Inter se exchange and carry forward of reservation.- \\n(i) Where in any recruitment year any vacancy cannot be filled \\nup due to non availability of a suitable person with benchmark \\ndisability or for any other sufficient reason, such vacancy shall \\nbe carried forward in the succeeding recruitment year and if \\nin the succeeding recruitment year also suitable person with \\nbenchmark disability is not available, it may first be filled by \\ninterchange among the following four categories of disabilities, \\nat one per cent each to each category: \\n(a) blindness and low vision; \\n(b) deaf and hard of hearing; \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Data.pdf', 'page': 35}, page_content=\"24 SWAMY'S HANDBOOK- 2024 \\n(c) locomotor disability including cerebral palsy, leprosy cured, \\ndwarfism, acid attack victims and muscular dystrophy; \\n(d) autism, intellectual disability, specific learning disability and \\nmental illness; \\nmultiple disabilities from amongst persons under Clauses \\n(a) to (d) including deaf-blindness, \\n(ii) Only when there is no person with benchmark disability available \\nfor the post in that year, the employer shall fill up the vacancy \\nby appointment of a person, other than a person with benchmark \\ndisability. \\n(iii) If the nature of vacancies in an establishment is such that a \\ngiven category of person cannot be employed, the vacancies \\nmay be interchanged with the prior approval of Department of \\nEmpowerment of Persons with Disabilities, among the above\\xad \\nmentioned four categories. \\n(iv) If any vacancy reserved for any category of benchmark disability \\ncannot be filled due to non-availability of a suitable person with \\nthat benchmark disability or, for any other sufficient reason, such \\nvacancy shall be carried forward as a 'backlog reserved vacancy' \\nto the subsequent recruitment year. \\n(v) In the subsequent recruitment year, the 'backlog reserved vacancy' \\nshall be treated as reserved for the category of disability for which \\nit was kept reserved in the initial year of recruitment. However, \\nif a suitable person with that benchmark disability is not available, \\nit may be filled by interchange among the categories of benchmark \\ndisabilities identified for reservation. In case no suitable person with \\nbenchmark disability is available for filling up the vacancy in the \\nsucceeding year also, the employer may fill up the vacancy by a \\nperson other than a person with benchmark disability. If the vacancy \\nis filled by a person with benchmark disability of the category for \\nwhich it was reserved or by a person of other category of benchmark \\ndisability by inter se exchange in the subsequent recruitment year, \\nit will be treated to have been filled by reservation. But if the \\nvacancy is filled by a person other than a person with benchmark \\ndisability in the subsequent recruitment year, reservation shall be \\ncarried forward for a further period up to two recruitment years \\nwhereafter the reservation shall lapse. In these two subsequent \\nyears, if situation so arises, the procedure for filling up the reserved \\nvacancy shall be the same as followed in the first subsequent \\nrecruitment year. \\n(vi) The Government establishment shall interchange vacancies only \\nif due process of recruitment, viz. proper advertisement of vacancy \\nto fill up the vacancies reserved for persons with benchmark \\ndisabilities has been complied with. \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Data.pdf', 'page': 36}, page_content='RESERVATIONS ANO. COIN:CESSIO NS IN APPOINTMENTS 25 \\n(:vii) In order to, ensure that cases of lapse of reservation are kept \\nto the· minimum, any recruitment of the persons with benchmark \\ndisabilities candidates shallf irst be counted against the additional \\nquota brought forward from previous years, if any, in their \\nchronological order. If candidates are not available for all the \\nvacancies, the older carried forward reservation would be filled \\nfirst and the current vacancies would be carried forward if not filled \\nup, provided that in every recruitment, the number of vacancies \\nreserved for Persons with Benchmark Disabilities including \\ncarried forward vacancies will be announced· beforehand, for the \\ninformation of all aspirants. \\n8. Horizontality of Reservation.- \\n(i) Reservation for backward classes of citizens (SCs, STs and \\nOBCs) is called vertical reservation and the reservation for \\npersons with benchmark disabilities and ex-servicemen is \\ncalled horizontal reservation. Horizontal reservation cuts across \\nvertical reservation (in what is called interlocking reservation) and \\npersons selected against the quota for persons with benchmark \\ndisabilities have to be placed in the appropriate category viz. \\nSC/ST/OBC/Unreserved depending upon the category to which \\nthey belong in the roster meant for reservation of SCs/STs/OBCs. \\nTo illustrate, if in a given year there are two vacancies reserved \\nfor the persons with benchmark disabilities and out of two \\npersons with benchmark disabilities appointed, one belongs to \\nScheduled Caste and the other belongs to Unreserved category, \\nthen the SC candidate with benchmark disability shall be adjusted \\nagainst the SC point in the reservation roster and the Unreserved \\ncandidate with benchmark disability against unreserved point \\nin the relevant reservation roster. In case none of the vacancies \\nfalls on point reserved for the SCs, the candidate under bench\\xad \\nmark disability belonging to SC shall be adjusted in future against \\nthe next available vacancy reserved for SCs. \\n(ii) Since the persons with benchmark disabilities have to be placed \\nin the appropriate category, viz. SC/ST/OBC/Unreserved in the \\nroster meant for reservation of SCs/STs/OBCs, the application form \\nfor the post should require the candidates applying under \\nthe quota reserved for persons with benchmark disabilities to \\nindicate whether they belong to SC/ST/OBC or Unreserved. Thus, \\nreservation for persons with benchmark disabilities is horizontal. \\n9. Certificate \\n(i)) To ensure proper implementation of the provisions- of reser\\xad \\nvation for persons with benchmark disabilities, the requisitioning \\nauthority while sending the requisition to the recruiting agency-or \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Data.pdf', 'page': 37}, page_content='26 SWAMY\\'S HANDBOOK- 2024 \\nauthority for filling up of posts shall furnish the following certificate \\nto the recruiting agency:- \\n\"t: is certified that the requirements of the THE RIGHTS OF \\nPERSONS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, 2016\\' which has become \\neffective from 19th day of April, 2017 and the policy relating to \\nreservation for persons with benchmark disabilities has been taken \\ncare of while sending this requisition.

Relaxation of standard of suitability \\n(i) If sufficient number of candidates with benchmark disabilities \\ncandidates are not available, candidates belonging to this category \\nmay be selected on relaxed standard to fill up the remaining \\nvacancies reserved for them provided they are mot found unfit \\nfor such post or posts. However, this provision shall not he used \\nto allow any relaxation in the eligibility criteria laid down for the \\nissuance of certificate of disability. \\n(ii) Same relaxed standard should be applied for all the candidates \\nwith Benchmark Disabilities, whether they belong to Unreserved/ \\nSC/ST/OBC. No further relaxation of standards will be considered \\nor admissible in favour of any candidate from any category \\nwhatsoever. \\n11.

Failure to observe the \\nprocedure may result in the inquiry getting vitiated. \\n7. The Complaints Committee when investigating the allegations should \\nmake recommendations on whether there is a prima facie substance in the \\nallegations which calls for conducting a formal inquiry. They should avoid \\nmaking any judgmental recommendations or expressing views which may \\nbe construed to have prejudiced their views while conducting such inquiry. \\n8. On receipt of the Investigation Report, the Disciplinary Authority \\nshould examine the report with a view to see as to whether a formal \\ncharge-sheet needs to be issued to the Charged Officer. As per Rule 14 (5), \\na decision on conducting the inquiry has to be taken after consideration of \\nthe reply of the Charged Officer. \\n9. If the Charged Officer admits the charges clearly and unconditionally, \\nthere will be no need for a formal inquiry against him and further action \\nmay be taken as per Rule 15 of the CCS (CCA) Rules. \\n10.

Even supersession in \\npromotion which denies/varies to disadvantage pay, allowances, pension \\nand conditions of service, is appealable. \\n2. Appeal has to be preferred within forty-five days of receipt of the \\norder appealed against, direct to the Appel.late Authority, who may condone \\ndelay, if valid reasons are given. \\n3. The appeal should contain all material statements and arguments \\non which the appellant relies and should be complete in itself. It should not \\nbe in disrespectful or improper language. \\n4.

The word \"consider\" has \\nbeen held to. imply \"due application of mind\" and the Appellate Authority \\nshould pass a speaking order. It is necessary that all the points raised by the \\nappellant are summarized in the order and are also logically discussed to \\nshow how they are not tenable or acceptable. \\n6. In an appeal against a major penalty, if the appellant specifically \\nrequests for a personal hearing, taking the assistance of a defence assistant \\nalso, this may be granted by the Appellate Authority at its discretion. \\n7. If the Appellate Authority proposes to enhance the penalty, it can do \\nso only after balding an inquiry if one is required to be held but not held \\nearlier and after issue of a show-cause notice. In cases where an inquiry has \\nalready been held, the appellant should be given a reasonable opportunity \\nto represent against the proposed enhanced penalty. \\n8.

Suspension and Subsistence Allowance \\n[ Swamy's - CCS (CCA) Rules, Swamy's FR & SR - Part-I \\nand Swamy's CCS (Pension) Rules] \\n1. When resorted to.- Suspension, in the context of disciplinary \\nproceedings, may be defined as temporary withdrawal of duties from \\na Government servant, pending inquiry into his/ her conduct, with \\nsimultaneous reduction in pay and withdrawal of some rights/privileges. \\n2. The provisions relating to suspension are scattered across several \\nrules. The main provisions are contained in Rule 10 of CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965 \\n(or corresponding rules governing the Government servant concerned) and \\nFRs 53, 54 and 55. \\n3. Suspension, though not a penalty, is to be resorted to sparingly. \\nWhenever a Government servant is placed under suspension not only does \\nthe Government lose his services but also pays him for doing no work. \\nIt also has a stigma attached to it. Therefore, the decision to place a \\nGovernment servant under suspension must be a carefully considered \\ndecision and each case would need to be considered on merits. \\nA Government servant may be placed under suspension, in the following \\ncircumstances: \\n(a) where, a disciplinary proceeding against him is contemplated or \\nis pending; \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Data.pdf', 'page': 83}, page_content=\"72 SWAMY'S HANIDBOOK - 2024 \\nor \\n(b) where, in the opinion of the competent authority, he has- engaged \\nhimself in activities prejudi€ial to the interest of the security of \\nthe State; \\nor \\n(c) where, a case against him in respect of any criminal offence is \\nunder investigation, inquiry or trial. \\n- GID (1), Rule 10 (1), Chapter 3. \\n4. A Disciplinary Authority may consider it appropriate to place \\na Government servant under suspension in the following circumstances. \\nThese are only intended for guidance and should not be taken as mandatory=- \\n(i) Cases where continuance in office of the Government servant \\nwill prejudice the investigation, trial or any inquiry (e.g. appre\\xad \\nhended tampering with witnesses, or documents); \\n(ii) where the continuance in officeof the Government servant is likely \\nto seriously subvert discipline in the office in which the public \\nservant is working; \\n(iii) where the continuancs in. office of the Government servant will \\nbe against the wider public interest [ other than those covered by \\n(i) and (ii) ] such as there is public scandal and it is necessary to \\nplace the Government servant under suspension to demonstrate \\nthe policy of the Government to deal strictly with officers involved \\nin such scandals, particularly corruption; \\n(iv) where allegations have been made against the Government \\nservant and preliminary inquiry has revealed that a prima facie \\ncase is made out which would justify his prosecution or is being \\nproceeded against in departmental proceedings, and where the \\nproceedings are likely to end in his conviction and/or dismissal, \\nremoval or compulsory retirement from service. \\nNOTE: \\n(a) In the first three circumstances, the Disciplinary Authority may \\nexercise his discretion to place a Government servant under \\nsuspension even when the case is under investigation and before \\na prima facie case has been established. \\n(b) Suspension may be desirable in the circumstances indicated \\nbelow:- \\n(i) any offence or conduct involving moral turpitude; \\n{ii) corruption, embezzlement or misappropriation of Govern\\xad \\nment money, possession of disp.roportionate assets, \\nmisuse of official powers for personal gain; \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Data.pdf', 'page': 84}, page_content='DISCIPLINE RULES 73 \\n(iii) serious negligence and dereliction of duty resulti ng in \\nconsiderable loss to Government; \\n(iv) desertion of duty; \\n(v) refusal or deliberate failure to carry out written orders of \\nsuperior officers.

Subsequent \\nreviews shall be made before expiry of the extended period of suspension. \\nExtension of suspension shall not be for a period exceeding one hundred \\nand eighty days at a time. \\nAn order of suspension made or deemed to have been made shall not \\nbe valid after a period of ninety days unless it is extended after review, for \\na further period before the expiry of ninety days. \\nProvided that no such review of suspension shall be necessary in the \\ncase of deemed suspension, if the Government servant continues to be \\nunder detention at the time of completion of ninety days of suspension \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Data.pdf', 'page': 86}, page_content='DLSGIPLINE ·RUL:ES 7:5 \\nand the ninety days period in such case w.iU count from the date the \\nGovernment servant detained in custody is released from detention or the \\ndate on which the fact of his release from ,detention Is intimated to his \\nAppointing Authority, whichever is later. \\n- GID.5 (26) and (17)., Rule 110 (6) and (7), Chapter 3. \\nIn a case where no charge-sheet is issued, the total period under \\nsuspension or deemed suspension, as the case may be, including any \\nextended period shall not exceed- \\n(a) 270 days from the date of order of suspension, if disciplinary \\nproceeding is contemplated or is pending against the Government \\nservant \\n(b) two years from the date of order of suspension, if in the opinion \\nof the Competent Authority the Government servant has engaged \\nin activities prejudicial to the interest of the security of the State \\nor where a case against him in respect of any criminal offence is \\nunder investigation, inquiry or trial \\n(c) two years from the date the Government servant detained in \\ncustody is released or the date on which the fact of his release \\nfrom detention is intimated to his appointing authority, whichever \\nis later, in case of deemed suspension.- OM, dated 19-10-2022. \\nThe suspension cannot be continued for long and that in spite of the \\ninstructions of DoP&T, the Disciplinary Authorities are not finalizing the \\ndisciplinary proceedings within the stipulated time. Also, in such cases, \\nthe Government is unnecessarily paying subsistence allowance without \\nextracting any work and if on the culmination of the disciplinary proceedings, \\nthe charged officer is exonerated from the charges, the Government has to \\nunnecessarily pay the full salary and treat the period of suspension as on \\nduty, etc. It is, therefore, desirable that timely review of suspension is \\nconducted in a just and proper manner and that the disciplinary proceedings \\nare finalized expeditiously. - GIO (28), Chapter 3. \\n9.

Headquarters during Suspension \\nAn officer under suspension is regarded as subject to all other \\nconditions of service applicable generally to Government servants and \\ncannot leave the station without prior permission. As such, the headquarters \\nof a Government servant should normally be assumed to be his last place of \\nduty. The order placing an officer under suspension should clearly \\nindicate what his headquarters would be. \\nHowever, where an individual under suspension requests for a change \\nof headquarters, there is no objection to a competent authority changing the \\nheadquarters if it is satisfied that such a course will not put Government to \\nany extra expenditure like grant of T.A. etc., or other complications. \\n- GID (8), Chapter 3. 11.

However, the recommendations in respect of those under suspension \\nshall be placed in a sealed cover. The sealed cover shall be opened/ \\nnot acted upon depending on the outcome of the disciplinary proceedings. \\nIf an officer is suspended subsequent to the meeting of the DPC but \\nbefore he is actually promoted, then the recommendations would be deemed \\nto have been placed in the sealed cover. - GJD (20), Chapter 3. \\n12.

Deputation and Foreign Service \\n[ Swamy's - FR & SR, Part-I ] \\n1. Foreign Service - General Principles \\nForeign service means the service of a Government servant, with the \\nsanction of Government under a non-Government employer. While in \\nsuch service, the Government servant is allowed to maintain his claim to \\npension and leave benefits, as if he continued in Government service. \\n(a) Important conditions governing foreign service: \\n1. All the terms and conditions of a Government servant's transfer \\nto foreign service should be settled well in advance in consultation with \\nthe foreign employer and communicated to the foreign employer, the \\nAccounts Officer and the Government servant concerned before relief. \\n2. If foreign service involves assumption of duties and responsibilities \\nof greater importance, pay should be fixed with due regard to such duties \\nand also to his status and pay in Government service. \\n3. Foreign service commences from the date of relief from Government \\nservice and ends on the date of taking over charge on reversion from \\nforeign service. Pay will be drawn from the foreign employer during the \\nentire foreign service. \\n4. If a Government servant is transferred to foreign service during leave, \\nforeign service commences from the date of the order and no leave salary \\nwill be paid after this date. \\n5. No gratuity or pension should be received from the foreign employer \\nwithout the sanction of the Government. \\n6. Contributions at the prescribed rates have to be paid to Government \\nfor pension/ contributory provident fund and leave salary. The contributions \\nare not payable during leave taken while in foreign service. Leave salary \\ncontribution is payable only when the foreign service is in India and is not \\nnormally payable when it is out of India. · \\n7. During foreign service out of India when no leave salary contributions \\nare recovered, leave and/ leave salary may be granted by the foreign \\nemployer. In such cases, the period of foreign service will not count \\nfor earning leave and the leave granted by the foreign employer during \\nforeign service will not be debited to his leave account. \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Data.pdf', 'page': 100}, page_content='DEPUTATION AND FOREIGN SERVICE 89 \\n8. A Government servant deputed on foreign service for three years \\nor more to the United Nations Secretariat or other United Nations Bodies, \\nthe lnternational Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction \\nand Development and the Asian Development Bank or the Commonwealth \\nSecretariat has an option to pay the pension contribution to Government \\nand count such service as qualifying for pension or avail of the retirement \\nbenefits under the rules of the aforesaid Organizations and not count such \\nservice as qualifying for pension. \\n9. A Government servant deputed on foreign service for one year \\nor more, but less than three years to the aforesaid Organizations, will be \\nallowed to receive from the foreign employer withdrawal benefits admissible \\nunder their rules. \\n10. While Central\\' Government Officers on foreign service to the Govern\\xad \\nments of developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America have the \\noption to pay pension contribution to the Government of India and count \\nthe foreign service for. pension, they will be allowed to receive gratuity \\npayable by those Governments which is not a pensionary benefit. \\n11. A Government servant on foreign service is entitled to pro forma \\npromotion in his parent department under the \"next below rule\" on \\n\"one-for-one\" principle. - FRs. 110 to 122. \\n(b) Special provisions regarding recognized All India Unions.- Pension \\ncontributions to be made by recognized All India Associations/ Unions/ \\nFederations are waived for not more than two serving employees at a time \\non foreign service with each such Association, etc. Leave salary contribution \\ncan be waived subject to the following conditions:- \\n1. The Association, etc., should bear the leave salary of the \\nconcerned employees for leave earned during service with them. \\n2. The employees should forgo claim for leave from Government for \\nthe period of such service. \\n3. Leave taken during the foreign service will be regulated under \\nthe rules of the Association, etc. \\n4. Leave salary will be paid by the Association for leave granted by \\nthem. \\n5. Leave will not be debited against the official\\'s leave account. \\n6. Balance of leave, if any, earned during foreign service will lapse \\non reversion to Government service. \\n7.

If the foreign employer pays contributions, the percentage is applied \\nto the pay actually drawn in foreign service. \\n3. If the contributions are paid by the Government servant himself, the \\npercentage is applied to the net Pay in Pay Level drawn during foreign service. \\nNet pay means the Pay in Pay Level that would be left after meeting the \\npension and leave salary contributions. In such cases, the percentage of \\nleave salary contribution is not applied directly on the actual pay drawn \\nduring foreign service, but an element of compensation is taken into \\naccount for both the contributions before the percentage for leave salary \\ncontribution is calculated. \\n4. Three types of cases may arise and three different formulae can be \\napplied in such cases- \\n(a) Where pension contribution alone is paid by the employee\\xad \\nr L = (F - P) x -----:ioo \\n(b) Where leave salary contribution alone is paid by the employee- \\nL = F x r \\n100 + r \\n(c) Where both the contributions are paid by the employee- \\nL = (F - P) x 100 + r \\nwhere L is the leave salary contribution, \\nF is the Pay in Pay Level actually drawn in foreign service, \\nP is the pension contribution, and \\nr is the rate of leave salary contribution. - Appendix-2. \\n3.

The tendency of treating deputation as a tool to \\nensure more comfortable, or even hometown postings is required to be \\ndiscouraged. The instrument of deputation serves public interest only when \\nthere is a rational connection with the .quallfications and work experience \\nof the deputationist, and the deputation continues for a reasonable period. \\nThis would also ensure that both the lending as well as the borrowing \\ndepartment benefit from the experience/ exposure of deputationist officer. \\nAll the Ministries/ Departments are therefore advised to ensure that \\ndeputations are strictly monitored by lending Government Departments. \\nRequests of the borrowing authorities for no objection to extension of \\ndeputations should be closely scrutinized to curb tendency to allow \\nextensions on extraneous grounds, and overstay. \\nThese instructions are in addition to the previous OMs on the subject, \\nand in no way dilute the responsibility of the deputationist and borrowing \\ndepartments to ensure that the deputationists are relieved in time on \\ncompletion of their approved tenures. - Order (8), Section I, Appendix 5. \\n(e) Extension.- Proposals for extensions beyond the period prescribed \\nin the Recruitment Rules should be sent to the Department of Personnel and \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Data.pdf', 'page': 104}, page_content='DEPUTATION AND FOREIGN SERVICE 93 \\nTraining only in rare and exceptional circumstances where extension in \\nthe period of deputation is considered absolutely necessary.

Inter se Seniority from- Reserve Panels.- The inter se seniority \\nof candidates nominated from reserve panels is determined based on the \\nconsolidated merit given by the selecting authority, such as the Union Public \\nService Commission (UPSC) or Staff Selection Commission (SSC). Reserve \\npanels are maintained by the UPSC, and if a vacancy arises due to non-joining \\nor early resignation / death of a candidate, a request for nomination from \\nthe reserve list can be made.

Starting a New Vacancy Register.- A new vacancy register should \\nbe started in two cases: \\n(i) when the recruitment .rules are notified in the Gazette, and \\n(ii) when there is an amendment to the Recruitment Rules that changes \\nthe percentage allocation for various modes of recruitment. \\n2. Determination of Relative Seniority \\n2.1. Rotation of Vacancies.- The relative seniority of direct recruits \\nand promotees is determined based on the rotation of vacancies allocated \\nfor each recruitment method as specified in the Recruitment Rules. \\n2.2. Inadequate Direct Rear.l!.l.irs.- If an adequate number of direct recruits \\nis not available in a particular year, the rotation of quotas for determining \\nseniority is limited to the available direct recruits and promotees.

Meghachandra Singh case. These principles include the deter.mination of \\nseniority based on the year of appointment and the delinking of seniority \\nfrom the year of vacancy. \\n2.4. Actual fear of Appointment.- The seniority of direct recruits and \\npromotees is determined based on the year they are appointed or formally \\nissued an appointment order and joined the cadre. \\n2.5. Joining in Subsequent Years.- If the appointment year is different \\nfrom the recruitment year, the seniority of the appointees is assigned \\naccording to the year of actual joining, and they do not receive seniority \\nfrom earlier years. \\n2.6. Rotation of Quotas.- - Rotation between promotees and direct \\nrecruits for determining inter se seniority occurs only to the extent of \\navailable direct recruits and promotees in a particular year. \\n2.7. Insufficient Direct Recruits or Promotees.- If an adequate number \\nof direct recruits or promotees is not available in a· given. year, the rotation \\nof quotas for determining seniority stops after the available candidates are \\nassigned their positions. \\n2.8. Bunching of Candidates.- If no direct recruits are available in a \\nyear, the available promotees are grouped together based on their position in \\nthe promotion panel, and· vice versa if no promotees are available. The \\nseniority is determined within each group. \\n2.9. Multiple Selections or Panels.- In cases where direct recruits or \\npromotees from multiple selections or panels join in the same year, those \\nappointed as a result of an earlier selection / panel.are placed higher in the \\nseniority list than those from subsequent selections/ panels. \\nD.

Seniority of Absorbees after Deputation \\nAbsorption after Deputation.- When a person is initially taken on \\ndeputation and later absorbed (as specified in the recruitment rules), their \\nseniority in the grade of absorption will usually be counted from the date \\nof absorption. If the person already held the same or equivalent grade on \\na regular basis in their parent department on the date of absorption, their \\nregular service in that grade will also be. considered in fixing their seniority. \\nThe seniority will be given from the earlier of the two dates: the date of holding \\nthe post on deputation or the date of appointment'.,on a regular basis to the \\nsame or equivalent grade in the parent department. \\nF. Seniority of Direct Transfers without Deputation \\nDirect Transfers without Deputation.- For individuals transferred \\nand absorbed directly without being on deputation (as provided in the \\nrecruitment rules), the same principles as contained above will be applicable \\nin determining their seniority. \\nG.

Suspension Cases.- If an officer under suspension is completely \\nexonerated after the conclusion of departmental proceedings, the officer \\nshould be promoted in the first available vacancy, and their seniority in the \\nnext higher grade should be fixed based on their position in the select list. \\nThe period during which junior officers were promoted to the higher grade \\nwill be counted towards the minimum period of service required for \\npromotion. \\n2.2.

Seniority of reverted and promoted officers \\n3.1. Penalty of Reversion.- In cases where a Government servant is \\nreverted to a lower post, grade, or service as a penalty and subsequently \\npromoted to a higher post, the order imposing the penalty should specify \\nthe period of reduction and whether the Government servant will regain \\ntheir original seniority upon re-promotion. \\n3.2. Reversion without future Increment postponement.- If the \\nreduction is for a specified period and does not affect future increments, \\nthe Government servant's seniority upon re-promotion may be fixed as \\nif the reduction had not occurred. \\n3.3. Reversion with future Increment postponement.- If the reduction \\nis for a specified period and affects future increments, the Government \\nservant's seniority upon re-promotion may be fixed by considering the \\nperiod of service rendered in the higher grade. \\n4. Seniority of Surplus Staff and Re-deployment \\n4.1. Surplus Employees.- Surplus employees, when re-deployed in a new \\norganization, are not entitled to count their past service in the previous \\norganization for determining their seniority or promotions. They are treated \\nas fresh entrants. \\n4.2. Inter se Seniority of Surplus Employees.- When multiple surplus \\nemployees of a particular grade in an office are selected on different dates \\nfor absorption in another office, their inter se seniority in the new office \\nwill be the same as in their previous office, provided no direct recruit or \\npromotee has been selected for that grade in between the dates of their \\nselection. \\n4.3. Simultaneous Re-deployment.- If multiple surplus employees of \\na particular grade in an office are simultaneously selected for redeployment \\nin another office, their inter se seniority in the new office will be the same \\nas it was in their previous office. \\n4.4 Seniority of a Person Transferred to a Lower Post under FR-15-A.\\xad \\nWhen a Government employee voluntarily requests a transfer to a lower \\npost under FR 15 (a) (2), it is neither considered a penal action nor a transfer \\nto a lower post in public interest. In such cases, as the person was already \\npromoted to a higher grade, returning to the lower post at the top of the \\nseniority list would adversely affect existing officers and undermine the \\npurpose of the transfer. Therefore, officers opting for transfer to a lower \\npost under FR-15, upon their own request, will be placed below all officers \\nregularly appointed to the lower grade on the date of transfer. \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Data.pdf', 'page': 118}, page_content='.SENtO~ITY, DPC AND PROMOTION J.07 \\n4.5.

Placement in Seniority List - Individuals appointed on compassionate \\ngrounds in a particular year should be placed at the bottom of the seniority \\nlist, below all candidates recruited/ appointed through direct recruitment or \\npromotion in that same year, regardless of the date of joining. \\n4.7 Seniority of Persons Selected for Different Posts in the Same Grade.- \\n4. 7.1. General Principles of Seniority.- In Central Services, the relative \\nseniority of direct recruits is determined by the order of merit in which \\nthey are selected on the recommendation of the UPSC or other selecting \\nauthority. Those appointed through an earlier selection hold seniority over \\nthose appointed through a subsequent selection. \\n4.7.2. Consolidated Order of Merit.- When persons are selected \\nfor different posts in the same grade requiring different qualifications, \\nthe UPSC and other selecting authorities should be requested to \\nrecommend candidates in a consolidated order of merit. \\n4.7.3.

(In some cases where the Reviewing Officer has no contact with \\nthe official, he should verify the correctness of the remarks of the Reporting \\nOfficer after making necessary enquiries.) \\n(ii) To ensure correct Reporting.- Reviewing Officer to carefully see \\nthat Reporting has been done as per instructions/ guidelines. If any vague/ \\nambiguous remarks are contained, the report to be returned to the Reporting \\nOfficer for necessary revision. If the Reviewing Officer disagrees with any \\npart of the report, he may state so with suitable remarks. If he \"agrees with the \\nassessment of the Reporting Officer\", his remarks should not be at variance \\nwith the report. \\n(iii) Reviewing Officer\\'s remarks final.- Where the Reviewing Officer \\ndisagrees and gives his own remarks duly substantiated, such remarks treated \\nas \\'final\\' and only these will be taken into account by DPC, etc. \\n12.

Instructions/ Guidelines relating to filling up the \\nintegrity column of Annual Performance Assessment Reports \\n(a) Supervisory Officers should maintain a confidential diary to record \\ninstances which create suspicion about the integrity of a subordinate. At the \\ntime of recording the annual confidential report, this diary should be \\nconsulted and the material in it utilized for filling the column about integrity. \\n(b) The column pertaining to integrity in the character roll should be \\nleft blank and a separate secret note about the doubts and suspicions \\nregarding the officer's integrity should be recorded simultaneously and \\nfollowed up. \\n(c) A copy of the secret note should be sent together with the character \\nroll to the next superior officers who should ensure that the follow-up action \\nis taken with due expedition. \\n(d) If, as a result of the follow-up action, an officer is exonerated, \\nhis integrity should be certified and an entry made in the character roll. \\nIf suspicions regarding his integrity are confirmed, this fact can also be \\nrecorded and duly communicated to the officer concerned. \\n(e) In all cases, where a Reporting Officer cannot in fairness to \\nhimself and to the officer reported upon, either certify integrity or make an \\nadverse entry, the Reporting Officer should make an entry in the integrity \\ncolumn to the effect that he has not watched the officer's work for sufficient \\ntime to be able to make any definite remark or that he has heard nothing \\nagainst the officer's integrity, as the case may be. This would be a factual \\nstatement to which there can be no objection. But it is necessary that \\na superior officer should make every effort to form a definite judgement \\nabout the integrity of those working under him, as early as possible, \\nso that he may be able to make a positive statement. \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Data.pdf', 'page': 134}, page_content=\"SENIORITY, DPC AND PROMOTION 123 \\n(f) There may be cases in which after a secret report / note has \\nbeen recorded expressing suspicion about an officer's integrity, the \\ninquiries that follow do not disclose sufficient material to remove the \\nsuspicion or to confirm it. In such a case, the officer's conduct should be \\nwatched for a further period, and, in the meantime, he should, as far as \\npracticable, be kept away from positions in which there are opportunities \\nfor indulging in corrupt practices. \\n3. The remarks against the integrity column of APARs of the officer \\nreported upon shall be made by the Reporting Officer in one of three \\noptions mentioned below:- \\n(a) Beyond doubt. \\n(b) Since the integrity of the officer is doubtful, a secret note is attached. \\n(c) Not watched the officer's work for sufficient time to form a \\ndefinite judgement but nothing adverse has been reported to me \\nabout the officer. - Order 18-A, Section 2. \\n11. Letters of Appreciation \\n1. Government policy in general discourages granting letter of apprecia\\xad \\ntion or note of commendation to its employees and placing it in the \\nAPAR Dossier. Appreciation of work should more appropriately be \\nrecorded in APAR rather than in letters of appreciation which do not give \\ncomplete perspective of the Government servant's good and bad points. \\n2. Letters of appreciation issued in the following cases by the authorities \\nspecified therein, may, however, be kept in the APAR Dossier of the \\nGovernment servants concerned:- \\n(a) Issued by the Government or a Secretary or Head of Department \\nin respect of any outstanding work done. \\n(b) Issued by special Bodies or Commissions or Committees, etc., or \\nexcerpts of their reports expressing appreciation for a Government \\nservant by name. \\n(c) From individual non-officials or from individual officials (other \\nthan a Secretary/ Head of Department) if confined to expressing \\nappreciation for services rendered far beyond the normal call \\nof duty: provided the Secretary or the Head of the Department \\nso directs. \\n3. The mere fact that a stray letter of appreciation goes into the \\nAPAR does not give the officer undue advantage in the matter of promotion \\nwhich is governed more by consideration of general and consistently \\nhigh performance than occasional flashes of good work. \\n- M.H.A., 0 .M.

Pay \\n1. Standard Pay Scales \\n[ Swamy\\'s - CCS (Revised Pay) Rules, 2016 and \\nSwamy\\'s FR & SR, Part-I - General Rules] \\nOn the recommendation of the Seventh Pay Commission, the existing \\nsystem of Pay Bands and Grade Pay has been dispensed with and new \\nfunctional levels have been arrived at by merging the Grade Pay with the \\npay in the Pay Band. All the existing levels have been subsumed in the new \\nstructure. The new pay structure has been devised in the form of a \\nPAY MATRIX to provide complete transparency regarding pay progression. \\nThe \"Pay Matrix\" comprises two dimensions. It has a Horizontal Range \\nin which each level corresponds to a functional role in the hierarchy and has \\nbeen assigned the numbers 1, 2 and 3 and so on till 18. The vertical range \\nfor each level denotes Pay Progression within that level. The starting point \\nof the Matrix is the minimum pay. The scales existing from 1-1-2006 have been \\nreplaced by the Pay Matrix with effect from 1-1-2016. \\n- CCS (Revised Pay) Rules, 2016. \\n(Pay Matrix table on Pages 126 and 127) \\n2. Pay Matrix \\n1. Pay Fixation in the new Pay Structure.- \\nThe basic pay on the date of implementation i.e., 1-1-2016 is multiplied \\nby a factor of 2.57, rounded off to the nearest rupee and the figure arrived at \\nis to be located in the new Pay Matrix (Refer Pages 126 and 127) in the level \\nthat corresponds to the employee\\'s grade pay on the date of implementation, \\nexcept in cases where the commission has recommended a change in the \\nexisting Grade Pay. If such an identical figure corresponds to any cell in the \\napplicable Level of the Pay Matrix, the same shall be the Pay.

No. 11-1/2016-IC, dated 6-7-2017. \\nThe construct of the Risk and Hardship Matrix, proposed above, is a \\nnew paradigm intended to rationalize the myriad allowances, their categories \\nand sub-categories that exist today. It would make the administration of \\nthese allowances simple and provide a framework for the Government for \\nfuture inclusion of any new allowance, which can be placed in the appro\\xad \\npriate cell depending upon the severity of the risk and hardship involved. \\nSalient features of the Matrix.- \\n(i) The matrix is divided into 9 cells based on Low, Medium and high \\nrisk juxtaposed with low, medium and high hardship. \\n(ii) One extra cell has been added to the top for Siachen Allowance, \\ni.e., R.H.

The rates will increase by 25% each time DA rises by 50%. \\n(v) The matrix is symmetrical.

There shall be three financial upgradations under the MACPS, \\ncounted from the direct entry grade on completion of 10, 20 and 30 years \\nservices, respectively, or 10 years of continuous service in the same Level \\nin Pay Matrix, whichever is earlier. \\n2. The MACPS envisages merely placement in the immediate next \\nhigher level in the hierarchy of the Pay Matrix as given in PART-A of Schedule \\nof the CCS (Revised Pay) Rules, 2016. Thus, the level at the time of \\nfinancial upgradation under the MACPS can, in certain cases where regular \\npromotion is not between two successive Pay Levels, be lower than what \\nis available at the time of regular promotion. In such cases, the higher level \\nattached to the next promotion post in the hierarchy of the concerned \\ncadre/organization will be given only at the time of regular promotion. \\n3.
